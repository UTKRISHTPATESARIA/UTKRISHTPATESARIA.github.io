Utkrisht is a grad student @ [Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/)<b> , IISc Bangalore</b>. He is advised by [Prof Arkaprava Basu](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arkapravab/index.html) and works at [CSL](https://csl.csa.iisc.ac.in/). His research is primarily focussed in Computer Systems(Architecture, Operating Systems & GPU Memory Subsystem).

He is currently working on out-of-memory GNN training on GPU's, identifying potential bottlenecks(CPU / GPU / Memory / PCIe) in the training pipeline and devising novel techniques to increase overall throuhgput and latency using [Deep Graph Library](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl)

As part of initial research problem he worked on out-of-memory graph processing on GPUs and exploring various memory oversubscription techniques using [unified memory](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/maximizing-unified-memory-performance-cuda/), [zero-copy](https://github.com/illinois-impact/EMOGI) and graph-partitioning. We did comprehensive analysis for graph traversal workloads on billion-scale graph and are currently designing a robust framework for applications under high memory pressure.

He previously held a position at <b>Nutanix</b> from 2020 to 2022 as an SRE where his work primarily revolved around troubleshooting issues on Nutanix stack. He is skilled in resolving issues related to Networking, Hardware, Virtualisation/Hypervisors, Storage on (AHV/ESXi/Hyper-V).

Before joining Nutanix he graduated with a major in CSE in 2020 from <b>KIIT</b>, BBSR, Odisha.
