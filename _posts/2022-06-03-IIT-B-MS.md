# IIT-B MS Interview Experience

## Pre-Interview Details

- Firstly we were given three choices under which we wish to pursue our MS by Research - Theory, Computing Systems, Intelligent Systems.
- A 3 hour(yes u read it right) subjective test was conducted(2nd May) where we had to answer questions from within our panel. Since I had selected Computing Systems I can speak only for that. I dont exactly remember the questions but most of them were from the resources provided before hand by them (lectures of faculty members @ IITB).
- The standard of questions were a bit higher than that of GATE but if we are conceptually sound one should be able to tackle it.
- The results were declared 3 days(5th May) later and my interview was the next day first slot.( I was on top of the list!)

## The Interview

It happened on Google Meet, though there were only four person joined in, but one of it was a conference room where multiple professors were listening.
My interview lasted close to 45 mins and it was intense!

Firstly they started with introduce yourself and why MS? <br />
I said I'm comfortable in OS/Architecture and so they started the grilling.

- ```Who invokes a scheduler?```
- ```Does OS need support for sync for itself?```
- ```What is paging?```
- ``` Array address is?```
- ``` Find page id from the above address?```
- ```Where is page table stored and how to access it?```
- ```What is the use of PT if we are accessing memory so many times?```
- ```Discussion on TLB and physical caches?```
- ```PIVT/VIPT/ which is suitable```
- ```Adding TLBâ€™s to pipeline, what is effect? i-cache & d-cache```
- ```Suppose after adding TLB no effect in perf only number of stage increases? Why we need it then?```
- ``` Effect of branch instructions and discussion on branch predictors```
- ```Infinite resources, discuss the scenario of how will u execute n instructions?```
- ```Time complexity of above, ignore loops/function calls.```
- ``` Can we run all n parallel? Data hazards discussion.```
- ```Few questions to identify types of languages, were simple but it was a rapid fire round```
- ```Why we use stack, how will you store function calls, is return address saved on PC?```
- ```Any issue we can have with stack - stack overflow```
- ```You have 3 files .o, .h and shared library how will these be compiled.```
- ```Static/Dynamic linking and loader```
- ```Where will preprocessor be used, and how will macros be handled?```
